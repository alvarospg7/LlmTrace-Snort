## Description

This project is designed to help network administrators and security analysts evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) when analyzing alerts generated by **Snort**.  
It implements a complete pipeline that:
- Extracts and preprocesses Snort alerts.
- Structures the data in JSON format.
- Sends the alerts to LLMs for automated analysis.
- Evaluates the generated responses according to predefined criteria.
- Generates interactive visual reports of the evaluation results.

## Origin

This repository is based on a fork of an original GitHub project intended for analyzing network traces from **Wireshark** using LLMs.  
The codebase has been **modified and adapted** to:
- Replace Wireshark trace parsing with Snort alert processing.
- Introduce new preprocessing and filtering parameters specific to Snort.
- Restructure scripts and folders for better automation and scalability.
- Add modules for dataset validation and report generation.
